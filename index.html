    <h3>Hello, it's me.</h3>
    
    <p>
      I'm passionate about code, coffee or anything that helps me lose track of time.<br/>
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heshie-brody/">Usually it's problem solving using code.</a>.<br/>
      My current tools of choice are: Ruby, Rails, React, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently fixing health @<a href="https://capablehealth.com">Capable Health</a>.</p>
    <p>Off hours and on weekends i'm automating shipping @<a href="https://shipmatix.com">Ship Matix</a>.</p>
    <p>
      The rest of my time is spent with my wife and two daughters.<br/>
      Winding down and the 25th hour of my day is usually reserved for catching up on Elon Musk tweets.
    </p>

    <h3>Things my Mom would be proud of:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I did not stay stuck when I didn't feel challenged and felt there was more to life then work that bored me. I thankfully(kudos to my awesome wife) transitioned back to tech after being a mortgage broker, rental broker, e-commerce account manager in a span of < 3 years.</li>
      <li>My top 7 <a href="https://dev.to/heshiebee/i-was-emailed-after-abandoning-a-registration-form-i-did-not-click-submit-this-is-not-ok-a63">Dev post</a> made top frontpage on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23384452">Hacker news.</a></li>
      <li>I was acknowledged by Oracle as an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html">On-Line Presence Security Contributor</a> after discovering an access control vulnerability in their Opower service.</li>

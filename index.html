    <h3>Hello, I'm Heshie.</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Now for my third person :)</b><br/>
      Heshie Brody is currently a Technical Lead at <a href="https://www.forthepeople.com/">Morgan and Morgan PA</a>, where he is the technical lead responsible for guiding the development of client web experiences.

      His extensive background includes a role as a founding engineer at Capable Health, where he contributed significantly to the creation of a scalable API and integration infrastructure. 
      Prior to this, he worked at Sitepod, focusing on their automated back office product, and at Adar Medical Uniforms, where he developed logistical warehouse solutions incorporating ERP and consumer-facing integrations. 
      Heshie is an alumnus of the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School’s</a> Software Engineering program. 

      Originally from Brooklyn, New York, Heshie discovered his passion for technology and tinkering at the age of 9 by disassembling computers.
      His interest in coding sparked at 14 when he began exploring the developer tab in Excel. 
      He self-taught programming using a "Visual Basic for Dummies" book, which he soon utilized to create a program that simulated a hard drive wipe, humorously installing it on his school’s computers.

      I'm passionate about code, coffee or anything that helps me lose track of time.<br/>
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heshiebrody/">Usually it's problem solving using code.</a>.<br/>
      My current tools of choice are: Ruby, Rails, React, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently fixing health @<a href="https://capablehealth.com">Capable Health</a>.</p>
    <p>
      The rest of my time is spent with my wife and two daughters.<br/>
      Winding down and the 25th hour of my day is usually reserved for catching up on Elon Musk tweets (posts...).

    <h3>Things my Mom would be proud of:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I did not stay stuck when I didn't feel challenged and felt there was more to life then work that bored me. I thankfully(kudos to my awesome wife) transitioned back to tech after being a mortgage broker, rental broker, e-commerce account manager in a span of < 3 years.</li>

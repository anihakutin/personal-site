    <h3>My day job:</h3>
    <p>
      I'm currently a Technical Lead at <a href="https://www.forthepeople.com/" target="_blank">Morgan and Morgan PA (America's largest personal injury law firm)</a>, where I guide the development of client web experiences (client and web portal). I manage a team of six software developers, and my duties include hiring, managing the product roadmap, and overseeing infrastructure. A giant law firm may sound boring, but think about it this way: How do you make sense of millions of calls, documents, and terabytes of client data? It takes thousands of people to run such an operation, and there are huge opportunities for automation, optimization, and adding AI to create a great web experience for a law firm of our size.<br/>
      <br/>
      My background includes a role as a founding engineer at Capable Health, where I helped create a scalable API and infrastructure for their modern healthcare backend, including e-commerce and payment integrations. Prior to that, I worked at Sitepodâ€”a CRM and back office solution built for the construction industryâ€”where I contributed to their inventory, job site planning, and analytics tool. I also worked at Adar Medical Uniforms, where I developed logistics software that incorporated ERP (SAP B1) and consumer-facing tools, including a packaging robot integration that increased our warehouse employee capacity sevenfold.<br/>
      <br/>
      I'm an alumnus of the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School's</a> software engineering program.<br/>
      <br/>
      I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. I discovered my passion for technology and tinkering at the age of nine by taking apart computers. I became interested in coding at age 14 when I began exploring the developer tab in Excel. I then taught myself programming using a "Visual Basic for Dummies" book.<br/>
      <br/>

    <br/>

    <h3>Shameless Plugs:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My work at Morgan & Morgan achieved a 1,600% increase in user growth and produced millions of dollars in revenue by shifting user communication from traditional phone calls to a digital platform.</li>
      <li>As a manager, I'm careful not to over-hire and I'm willing to forgo traditional practices when I believe a decision will benefit team focus and efficiency. For example, when I first launched our backend in my current role, <a href="https://x.com/heshiebee/status/1745311650628894970?s=20" target="_blank">I decided to host our services on Render.com</a> instead of AWS. This choice saved both time and money by avoiding setup time and eliminating the need to keep a DevOps engineer on the team, while also providing a better development experience, exemplifying this approach.</li>  
      <li>I did not stay stuck when I no longer felt challenged in previous jobs (including as a mortgage broker) and realized there was more to life than work that bored me. I transitioned to technology after three years in other lines of work (kudos to my awesome wife for the support).</li>
      <li>My <a href="https://dev.to/heshiebee/i-was-emailed-after-abandoning-a-registration-form-i-did-not-click-submit-this-is-not-ok-a63" target="_blank">post</a> on how data is collected without consent and marketing tools taking advantage of this made the top 7 list on <a href="Dev.to" target="_blank">Dev.to</a> and the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23384452">Hacker news.</a></li>
      <li>I discovered an access control vulnerability in Oracle's Opower service and was acknowledged by the company as an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html" target="_blank">On-Line Presence Security Contributor</a> as a result.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h3>People Who Have Made a Profound Impact on My Life Personally or Professionally:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My awesome wife who always pushes me to do my best and is never afraid to speak the truth.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aviflombaum/" target="_blank">Avi Flombaum</a>, founder and dean of Flatiron School. His Ruby On Rails courses and guidance will forever remain in my heart.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fried-chaim/" target="_blank">Chaim Fried</a>, my current CTO and the person who guided me back into tech and advised me to join a code bootcamp.</li>
      <li><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/clarkvalberg/" target="_blank">Clark Valberg</a>, founder of InVision and currently runs the <a href="https://www.tiferes.vc/" target="_blank">Tiferes VC fund</a>. Clark has helped me with some of my major career decisions and is always a listening ear away.</li>

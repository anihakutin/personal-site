    <h3>Hello, I'm Heshie.</h3><br/>

      <b>Now for my third person :)</b><br/>
      Heshie Brody is currently a Technical Lead at <a href="https://www.forthepeople.com/">Morgan and Morgan PA</a>, where he is the technical lead responsible for guiding the development of client web experiences.<br/>

      His extensive background includes a role as a founding engineer at Capable Health, where he contributed significantly to the creation of a scalable API and integration infrastructure.<br/>
      Prior to this, he worked at Sitepod, focusing on their automated back office product, and at Adar Medical Uniforms, where he developed logistical warehouse solutions incorporating ERP and consumer-facing integrations.<br/>
      Heshie is an alumnus of the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School’s</a> Software Engineering program.<br/>

      Originally from Brooklyn, New York, Heshie discovered his passion for technology and tinkering at the age of 9 by disassembling computers.
      His interest in coding sparked at 14 when he began exploring the developer tab in Excel. 
      He self-taught programming using a "Visual Basic for Dummies" book, which he soon utilized to create a program that simulated a hard drive wipe, humorously installing it on his school’s computers.

    <p>
      I'm passionate about code, coffee or anything that helps me lose track of time.<br/>
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heshiebrody/">Usually it's problem solving using code.</a>.<br/>
      My current tools of choice are: Ruby, Rails, React, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>I'm currently fixing health @<a href="https://capablehealth.com">Capable Health</a>.</p>
    <p>
      The rest of my time is spent with my wife and two daughters.<br/>
      Winding down and the 25th hour of my day is usually reserved for catching up on Elon Musk tweets (posts...).

    <h3>Things my Mom would be proud of:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I did not stay stuck when I didn't feel challenged and felt there was more to life then work that bored me. I thankfully(kudos to my awesome wife) transitioned back to tech after being a mortgage broker, rental broker, e-commerce account manager in a span of < 3 years.</li>
      <li>My top 7 <a href="https://dev.to/heshiebee/i-was-emailed-after-abandoning-a-registration-form-i-did-not-click-submit-this-is-not-ok-a63">Dev post</a> made top frontpage on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23384452">Hacker news.</a></li>

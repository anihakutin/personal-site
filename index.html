    <p>
      <b>Now for my third person :)</b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Heshie Brody is currently a Technical Lead manager at <a href="https://www.forthepeople.com/">Morgan and Morgan PA (America's largest personal injury law firm)</a>, where he is responsible for guiding the development of client web experiences including hiring, product roadmap and infrastructure.
      I know a giant law firm sounds kinda boring (and you're probably wondering why he would take a job like that...), but I want you to think about it this way; how does one make sense of millions of calls, documents and terabytes of client data.
      Think about how many thousands of people it takes to run an operation like that and the opportunity for automation, optimization and streamlining a great web experience coupled with AI can bring to a law firm of that size.<br/>
      Yeah, that's his day job. Pretty cool, isn't?<br/>
      <br/>
      His extensive background includes a role as a founding engineer at Capable Health, where he contributed significantly to the creation of a scalable API and integration infrastructure.<br/>
      Prior to this, he worked at Sitepod, focusing on their automated back office product, and at Adar Medical Uniforms, where he developed logistical warehouse solutions incorporating ERP and consumer-facing integrations.<br/>
      Heshie is an alumnus of the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School's</a> Software Engineering program.<br/>
      <br/>
      Originally from Brooklyn, New York, Heshie discovered his passion for technology and tinkering at the age of 9 by disassembling computers.
      His interest in coding sparked at 14 when he began exploring the developer tab in Excel. 
      He self-taught programming using a "Visual Basic for Dummies" book, which he soon utilized to create a program that simulated a hard drive wipe, humorously installing it on his school's computers.

      <b>P.S. Since this is technically the third person it may come across as a bit of a PR piece to some. If it's not your type of thing then visiting his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heshiebrody/" target="_blank" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</a> page may be more up your alley.</b>

    <h3>Shameless Plugs:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I did not stay stuck when I no longer felt challenged and realized there was more to life then work that bored me. I thankfully (kudos to my awesome wife) transitioned back to tech after being a mortgage broker, rental broker, e-commerce account manager and finally back to tech in a span of less then 3 years.</li>
      <li>My top 7 <a href="https://dev.to/heshiebee/i-was-emailed-after-abandoning-a-registration-form-i-did-not-click-submit-this-is-not-ok-a63">Dev post</a> made top frontpage on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23384452">Hacker news.</a></li>
      <li>I was acknowledged by Oracle as an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html">On-Line Presence Security Contributor</a> after discovering an access control vulnerability in their Opower service.</li>
      <li>I'm careful not to over-hire and I'm willing to forgo the "norms" when I think a decision is one that benefits team focus and efficiency. For instance, here's <a href="https://x.com/heshiebee/status/1745311650628894970?s=20">a recent decision</a> I made while developing the infrastructure for a web application, exemplifying this approach.</li>
      <li>My recent work has achieved a remarkable 1,600% increase in user growth and uncovered millions in revenue (exact numbers are under NDA ofc...) for a web application, shifting client preference from traditional phone calls to a call center towards this digital platform.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
  
    <h3>People Who Have Made a Profound Impact on My Life Personally or Professionally:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aviflombaum/">Avi Flombaum</a>, founder and dean of Flatiron School. His Ruby On Rails courses and guidance will forever remain in my heart.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fried-chaim/">Chaim Fried</a>, my current CTO and the person who guided me back into tech and advised me to join a code bootcamp.</li>
      <li>My awesome wife who always pushes me to do my best and is never afraid to speak the truth.</li>
    </ul>
